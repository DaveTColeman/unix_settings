# UBUNTU NOTES

## Video Editing

### Rotate video

    I just tried it with avidemux. I use xvid and also I don't use the english version of avidemux so I may not describe it perfectly but you'll get it.

    1. start avidemux and load your video.

    2. choose avi from the button at the (almost) bottom left.

    3. choose the line containing Xvid4 on the top video button at the left.

    4. Press the filters button which is the third button on the left.

    5. Find rotate filter, double click it, choose angle and click ok.

    6. Now close filters windows.

    7. Press the Save button and enter a new name name.avi.

### Mount Filesystem while in Recovery Mode

    When you boot into Recovery Mode, enter the following two commands before doing anything else:

    mount --options remount,rw /
    mount --all

    These commands will set Recovery Mode to how it should have been.


### Mount USB Drive while in Recovery Mode

See list of mountable names
    sudo fdisk -l

Make the mount point
    mkdir /media/usb_drive

Mount it
    mount -t vfat /dev/sdc /media/usb_drive


### Restore Video Settings

    cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf.failsafe /etc/X11/xorg.conf


### Boot with Safe Video Settings

add these linux kernel boot options:

    nomodeset nointremap vga=0x361.

### See Disk Free Space of Filesystem

    df -h


### Virual Box Resize
    VBoxManage modifyhd YOUR_HARD_DISK.vdi --resize SIZE_IN_MB


### Compare Two Directories, Excluding git files
    diff -r -x '.rosinstall*' -x '*.git' moveit/src moveit_dave/src

### Delete all subdirecetories with folder name '.svn'

First check what you will delete:
    find . -name .svn -exec ls {} \;

Then delete them:
    find . -name .svn -exec rm -rf {} \;

Patterns work too:
    find . -name "*.FILEEXTENSION" -exec ls {} \;

### Search system ignoring errors
    gr NEEDLE 2> /dev/null


### Kill all processs with given partial name

### Debugging Tool

a useful diagnostic, instructional, and debugging tool.  System administrators, diagnosticians and trouble-shooters will find it invaluable for solving problems with programs for which  the  source  is  not  readily
available  since they do not need to be recompiled in order to trace them.  Students, hackers and the overly-curious will find that a great deal can be learned about a system and its system calls by tracing even ordinary pro‚Äê
grams.  And programmers will find that since system calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel interface, a close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug isolation, sanity checking and  attempting
to capture race conditions.
